    <h4>tri-dns.net and eu.tri-dns.net now redirect to the main website.</h4>
  <p>Due to search engines indexing tri-dns.net and putting it near the top, I've made both domains redirect to the main one.</p>

  <div class="POST">
    <h4>DNSSEC REENABLED ACROSS ALL REGIONS!</h4>
  <p>Due to past issues with DNSSEC it was temporarly disabled on all nodes, it was reenabled on Europe as a test ground on 12/1/24.</p>
  <p>It has sense been reenabled on the North American Node after extensive testing on the less popular EU node.</p>

<div class="POST">
  <h4>IMPORTANT!</h4>
<p>DoQ, DoH/3 (And DoH) seemed to have been fixed by me tinkering around, working on fixes for the past few days, one of the fixes tested seems to have worked*.</p>
<p>Using these protocols should be safe now, though I do still recommend at least having 1 DoT service as a backup, as that one seems to work no matter what.</p>
