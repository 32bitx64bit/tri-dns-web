    <h4>DoQ instability reason found, no. Now fixed! (maybe)</h4>

    <p>The issue has been fixed, it was a issue with Technitium DNS server, and their DoQ service.</p>
    <p>The issue should now be fixed, though this fix was just rolled out so do still keep DoT / DoH as a backup just incase.</p>
    <p>Until I do further testing to confirm its 100% safe to use.</p>
    <p>(If you want to read the original post see git commit 248c597 on the tri-dns-web repo.)</p>

    <h4>DNS-over-QUIC instability.</h4>
  <p>It seems that DNS-over-QUIC is still unstable. It could be anything, Dependencies,</p>
  <p>Debian 12 related issues, or just the backbone software itself.</p>
  <p>Anyways, I generally recommend staying AWAY from DoQ, and use Dns-over-https/3 if you want the benefits of DoQ</p>
 <p>I'll do another update post when / if DoQ ever gets a fix.</p>

    <h4>Tri-DNS now has a dedicated privacy page.</h4>
  <p>I believe in being as transparent as possible in what Tri-DNS does, and doesn't log,</p>
  <p>in a simple manner that is easy to understand. Instead of a 5 page essay like most privacy polcies,</p>
  <p>with complex terms that only a a dedicated privacy nerd could understand, or lawyer.</p>
  <p>You can find info : <a href="https://dns.triro.net/privacy/">here</a></p>

    <h4>tri-dns.net and eu.tri-dns.net now redirect to the main website.</h4>
  <p>Due to search engines indexing tri-dns.net and putting it near the top, I've made both domains redirect to the main one.</p>

    <h4>DNSSEC REENABLED ACROSS ALL REGIONS!</h4>
  <p>Due to past issues with DNSSEC it was temporarly disabled on all nodes, it was reenabled on Europe as a test ground on 12/1/24.</p>
  <p>It has sense been reenabled on the North American Node after extensive testing on the less popular EU node.</p>

  <h4>IMPORTANT!</h4>
<p>DoQ, DoH/3 (And DoH) seemed to have been fixed by me tinkering around, working on fixes for the past few days, one of the fixes tested seems to have worked*.</p>
<p>Using these protocols should be safe now, though I do still recommend at least having 1 DoT service as a backup, as that one seems to work no matter what.</p>
